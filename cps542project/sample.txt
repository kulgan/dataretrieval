For some hosts and  programs this will cause  no disruptions, but  for
others some problems may arise.   For example, with over five  hundred
entries in the table, the addition of 500 names could exceed the space
allocated to  store  the table  in  some programs.   Another  possible
problem is that period (or dot, ".")  is not now a legal character  in
host names,  and some  programs may  not be  able to  parse these  new
names.
